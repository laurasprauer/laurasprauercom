        <h2>As a Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve been developing on the web for the past {exp} years. After
          getting an undergraduate degree in fine art, I&apos;ve spent most of
          my post-collegiate life focusing on my technical skills. My digital
          art focus with a secondary computer science minor set me on a web
          designer path early on - eventually leading me to become a developer
          full time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working fresh out of college as an interactive designer had me
          building the websites I designed. While I enjoyed creating with
          marketing agencies, I loved coding and wanted to expand my front end
          knowledge. I took a break from being a designer to transition to
          JavaScript developer roles. This is where I discovered the excitement
          of working at startups.
        </p>
        <p>
          When working alongside a small team on a new product, you have a major
          influence on company direction and culture. There&apos;s a need for
          flexibility, creative solutions, and thinking on your feet.
          Unfortunately, most startups fail, but when you find a startup that
          succeeds it can be a wild ride.
